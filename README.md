# MQTT People counter
This repository contains the code (to be flashed on an ESP32 using the Arduino IDE) which allows to create a sensor capable of counting the people inside a room. It works thanks to the VL53L1X sensor by ST Microelectronics. The number of people inside the room will then be shared using the MQTT protocol.

## More instructions coming...
